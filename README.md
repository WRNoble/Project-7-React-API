# Title

React Front-End API.  This is the front-end of a website which (once completed) connects to an Express/Mongo API.  It has full CRUD functionality allowing the user to Create, Read, Update, and Delete Roman emperors after searching by either name or ID.  

## Getting Started

The user should have access to the internet and understand how buttons and forms work.  The user will be presented with a screen displaying the all sixty-eight Roman Emperors who have ruled the Empire up until its permanent split in the late fourth century.  I user can click on the emperor's name and a screen appears telling the user basic information about the Roman Emperor they selected.  The delete button, located at the bottom of the screen presents the user with a form, at the bare minimum the user should include the name of the emperor they wish to delete.  Likewise there are both create and edit buttons, the user must include the name name of the emperor in order to edit or create a new entry.  

### Prerequisites

This site was built using React.js and utilized other npm packages such as react bootstrap, formkit, and axios.
